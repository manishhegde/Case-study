## General Information
- We have given the set data of loans.
- To make the sanity check and arrive on statistics 
- The data given below contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
- "loan"data set has been used to arrive the conclusions
